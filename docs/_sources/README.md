## Lecture schedule

This course will be run in person. We will meet three times every week: twice for lectures and once for the lab. You can refer to the [Calendar](https://ubc-mds.github.io/calendar/) for lecture and lab times and locations. Lectures of this course will be a combination traditional live lecturing, class activities, and pre-recorded videos. Drafts of the lecture notes for each week will be made available earlier in the week.  

This course occurs during **Block 6** in the 2024/25 school year.

The labs are going to be in person. There will be a lot of opportunity for discussion and getting help during lab sessions. Please make good use of this time.  

## Installation

We are providing you with a `conda` environment file which is available [here](env-dsci-575.yml). You can download this file and create a conda environment for the course and activate it as follows. 

```
conda env create -f env-dsci-575.yml
conda activate 575
```

We've only attempted to install this environment file on a few machines, and you may encounter issues with certain packages from the `yml` file when executing the commands above. This is not uncommon and may suggest that the specified package version is not yet available for your operating system via `conda`. When this occurs, you have a couple of options:

1. Modify the local version of the `yml` file to remove the line containing that package.
2. Create the environment without that package. 
3. Activate the environment and install the package manually either with `conda install` or `pip install` in the environment.   

_Note that this is not a complete list of the packages we'll be using in the course and there might be a few packages you will be installing using `conda install` later in the course. But this is a good enough list to get you started._ 


## Course communication
<details>
  <summary>Click to expand!</summary>

We all are here to help you learn and succeed in the course and the program. Here is how we'll be communicating with each other during the course. 

### Clarifications on the lecture notes or lab questions

If there is any clarification on the lecture material or lab questions, I'll post a message on our course channel and tag you. **It is your responsibility to read the messages whenever you are tagged.** (I know that there are too many things for you to keep track of. You do not have to read all the messages but please make sure to carefully read the messages whenever you are tagged.) 

### Questions on lecture material or labs

If you have questions about the lecture material or lab questions please post them on the course Slack channel rather than direct messaging me or the TAs. Here are the advantages of doing so: 
- You'll get a quicker response. 
- Your classmates will benefit from the discussion. 

When you ask your question on the course channel, please avoid tagging the instructor unless it's specific for the instructor (e.g., if you notice some mistake in the lecture notes). If you tag a specific person, other teaching team members or your colleagues are discouraged to respond. This will decrease the response rate on the channel. 

Please use some consistent convention when you ask questions on Slack to facilitate easy search for others or future you. For example, if you want to ask a question on Exercise 3.2 from Lab 1, start your post with the label `lab1-ex2.3`. Or if you have a question on lecture 2 material, start your post with the label `lecture2`. Once the question is answered/solved, you can add "(solved)" tag before the label (e.g., (solved) `lab1-ex2.3`). Do not delete your post even if you figure out the answer on your own. The question and the discussion can still be beneficial to others.  

### Questions related to grading

For each deliverable, after I return grades, I'll let you know who has graded what in our course Slack by opening an issue in the course GitHub repository. If you have questions related to grading
- First, make sure your concerns are reasonable (read the ["Reasonable grading concerns" policy](https://ubc-mds.github.io/policies/)). 
- If you believe that your request is reasonable, open a regrade request on Gradescope. 
- If you are unable to resolve the issue with the TA, send a Slack message to the instructor, including the appropriate TA in the conversation. 

### Questions related to your personal situation or talking about sensitive information
 
I am open for a conversation with you. If you want to talk about anything sensitive, please direct message me on Slack (and tag me) rather than posting it on the course channel. It might take a while for me to get back to you, but I'll try my best to respond as soon as possible.
